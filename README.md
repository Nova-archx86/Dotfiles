# Dot files
This repo just contains configuration files and scripts for my semi-minimal arch linux build
## Installation:
Once the base install of arch linux is finished, if you wish to install my packages and configs, simply clone the repo 
and run bin/install.sh

    cd dotfiles; chmod +x bin/install.sh; bin/install.sh
